- 👋 Hi, I’m @spindlersbalagan
- 👀 I’m interested in the shared neuroscience of sleep and anaesthesia, especially in it's practical application as an anesthesiologist. Currently this applies to analyzing sleep and anaesthesia-spindles and putting them in context with patient's age, anaesthesia strategy chosen and correlation of spindle activity during different states of frontooccipital polarity so common o states of unconsciousness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about automated spindle and K-complex-detection and different states of burst-suppression in anaesthesia and beyond
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the cited topics
